LZ77 is the name given to a lossless data compression
algorithm published in papers by Abraham Lempel and Jacob
Ziv in 1977. This algorithm forms the basis for many LZ
variations including LZW, LZSS and others. LZ77 is known
as a dictionary encoding algorithm.
This program implements a very close approximation to the
LZ77 compression algorithm.  While it may not match that
algorithm exactly, the match is close enough to satisfy
the primary purpose of the program, which is to explain
how the LZ77 algorithm works.
This program is provided for educational purposes only. If
you use the program for any purpose, you use it at your
own risk.  The author of the program accepts no
responsibility for any damages that may result from your
use of the program.
The program was specifically designed to serve its primary
purpose of education.  No thought was given to speed,
efficiency, memory utilization, or any other factor that
would be important in a program written for production
data compression purposes.  In some cases, the program was
purposely made less efficient by using two or more
statements to accomplish a task that could be accomplished
by a single more complex statement.
Several sample messages are hard-coded into the program.
You can switch between those messages by enabling and
disabling specific messages using comments and then
recompiling the program.  You can also insert your own
message and recompile the program to use your message if
you choose to do so.
The program first encodes a message into a collection of
Tuple objects stored in an ArrayList object using a very
close approximation to the LZ77 lossless data compression
algorithm.
Then the program decodes the message by extracting the
information from the Tuple objects and using that
information to reconstruct the original message.
The program does not actually convert the encoded
(compressed) message into a bit stream, although it
wouldn't be difficult to do so.  Since the purpose of the
effort was to illustrate the behavior of the LZ77
algorithm, and not to write a production data compression
program, converting the compressed data into a bit stream
was considered to be superfluous to the purpose.  However,
the program does provide a theoretical analysis of the
amount of compression that should be achieved if the
results were converted into a bit stream.
This program was tested against the demonstration Java
program named LZ that can be downloaded from
http://www.mathcs.sjsu.edu/faculty/khuri/animation.html
Neither the source code from that program nor the source
code from any other existing Java program was consulted
during the development of the code for this program.
Although numerous technical descriptions of the LZ77
algorithm were consulted, all of the source code in this
program is the original work of this author.
The animated interactive nature of the demonstration
program mentioned above was extremely helpful in helping
this author to understand the LZ77 algorithm.
The output from this program matches the output from the
above mentioned demonstration program for 60 characters of
input data and values of 10 for searchWindowLen and
lookAheadWindowLen. (The demonstration program is limited
to an input data length of 60 characters.)
Quite a lot of output material is displayed on the screen
when this program is running.  This material is designed to
be used in a tutorial lesson to explain the behavior of
the LZ lossless data compression algorithm.
The program was tested using J2SE 5.0 and WinXP.  J2SE 5.0
or later is required due to the use of generics.

        The original message has been encoded into a collection of
        Tuple objects where each object contains the following
        information:
        1. offset points backwards to the beginning of a
        match relative to the current location. Has a
        value of 0 if there is no match for the next
        character.
        2. stringLen specifies the length of the match or 0
        if there is no match for the next character.
        3. nextChar is the first non-matching character
        following a match, or the next character if there
        is no match.

        It would not be particularly difficult at this point
        to iterate on the collection and to produce a binary
        stream containing these three values.  For example,
        depending on the values specified for searchWindowLen
        and lookAheadWindowLen, the first two values listed above
        could be encoded into the number of bits required to
        contain the largest possible offset value and the
        largest possible stringLen value.  The character from the
        Tuple object could be encoded into eight bits.  Then,
        the set of bits required to describe the Tuple could be
        inserted into a stream of bits.

        This demonstration program does not produce such a
        compressed binary file.
